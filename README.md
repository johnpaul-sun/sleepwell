## SLEEPWELL 
# Description

The project is a sleep cycle assessment and recommendation web application. 
It will collect information from users such as their name, age, and gender, as well as answers to a series of questions related to their sleep habits and patterns. 

The app will use this information to assess the user's sleep cycle and provide personalized recommendations for improving their sleep. 
The app will be developed using Next.js, TailwindCSS, Laravel, and TypeScript, with a focus on creating a responsive design that can be easily converted into a mobile app using Capacitor. 

The project will be completed using an Agile development method. 
The app will also include an admin panel for viewing user feedback and managing the questions and recommendations. 
The final goal of this project is to create a recommendation app using Collaborative Filtering Algorithm.
